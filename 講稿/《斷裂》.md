# 《斷裂》讀後心得

感情最基本的架構是：一方在引領；另一方在跟隨。如果這跟隨變得盲目、佔據價值觀的根基，那跟隨方就有如吊橋，而引領方就如同那唯一在岸上的立柱，如果引領方選擇放掉那名為關係的纜繩，那橋體就只有崩塌的結局。

我覺得我們要去教會下一代，去有一個「這件事（任何事）有可能發生」的心態。不只是接受這世界有同性戀等多元性向，而是去單純的接受任何事都有可能發生。這樣在譬如說認定自己是同性戀，但某天突然愛上一個異性時，孩子們會去理解一個標籤不是標上了就永遠。活著就是一個動態的過程，你們會改變，我不希望孩子們因為一些（就算是在自我探索後認定的）事實，而因此失去了人生本該有的可能。因為只要活著，事實就有可能被推翻，連客觀的科學都是如此了，那主觀的意識更有可能。

這是新世代該有的觀念，而我們要教會他們，讓他們不會在認定的事實改變後價值觀、世界觀崩塌。To gain the ability to float, not jump suspended by cables and towers, but to be able to float by their own. 

你可以一直認定，自己的一個性向。但我覺得放棄能改變的心態，是不值的。

我覺得多元性向就是半個點子，他看似開放、先進、正確，但若不懂的人只一味的崇尚他，那他仍舊是個枷鎖而已。而至今，我沒看到多少人真的懂這個光譜的意義。扣除掉真的多元性別的同溫層外，我覺得真的鮮少人懂。我們不該去講「啊，你也有可能喜歡男性呢」或者「對呀，有可能是同性戀」，我覺得（當然我可能比較激進一點）那個「可能」本身也是一種刻板、一種枷鎖。

多元性別，不是一個可以被當「可能性」的東西，更不是你拿來合理化侵犯身體自主權的藉口

It's fundamental contradicting to support diversity while giving them different labels. It's simply impossible, logically, of one thing is diverse, then no it's not possible to label them, each and every one. A diversity is an unity. 

I don't speak on behalf of any community, but speaking on my own observation, and some simple logical consistency. 

It's "more similar" not "we're the same and different from y'all"

Digitalizing ideas are one of the most horrifying thing human could do

Massecre originates from such action.

Analog might also bring division, and conflicts. Possibly even things like betrayal. But at least, at the bare minimum, we're always working at our own interest, an interest that must centered around ourself. We're individual, and if we treat ourselves like such, then blindful actions could be prevented. A cooperative community isn't by centering around certain ideas, but to broaden your range of friendness. To accept more types of individuals, rather than 崇尚特定、單一的理念。

Discrimination is not about falsive statement, but rather unproper relation. Actually most discriminations, are facts. I like him, because he's a man. Isn't false, I mean biologically a man might be a correct statement. But relating such fact, to a decision is incorrect. A better way rh phrase it will be I like him, because he acts mannly. Labels are static, and there's a way to phrase, to connect static label to a dynamic object. And it's done by attaching it not directly to the dynamic object, but the static past it creates. Like a person's action, their wording, are all examples. They're the things they preform, or with a broader definition create, generate. Those belongs to past and hence static. Those action, though still can't be deleted, are at least changeable. People when dislike solve attributes could at least change how their act, and be tagged with different attribute. One could act mannly in a period of their life, while later changed to act femaly

I don't believe words' meaning could change, at least in one's lifetime, under one's will, easily.
